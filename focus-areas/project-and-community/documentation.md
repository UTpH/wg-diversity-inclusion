## Question

**Question:**  What is the thoroughness, and accessibility of documentation according to a set of criteria. This includes README/CONTRIBUTING (TBD)


## 1. Description

Documentation is codified knowledge. Documentation can be on the processes and practices of the community, thus empowering participants to contribute with certainty for how and why things are happening. Documentation can be on the artifacts produced by the community and as such empower participants to know where to contribute and what kind of contributions further the goals of the community.


## 2. Sample Objectives

- (Accessibility Screen Reader)Documentation is accessible according to x standard for screen readers (which tool to use?)
- (Awareness) Documentation is findable
- (Clarity) Documentation is easy to follow and structured intuitively
- (Relevance) Documentation is regularly updated
- (Relevance) Environment builds are up to date
- (Non-Technical Accessibility) Documentation limits use of unnecessary technical jargon
- (Inclusion) Documentation does not include non-inclusive language (this could be ‘brogrammer’ language, or exclusionary/derogatory language.
- (FOSS standards) README & CONTRIBUTING files provide intended information


## 3. Sample Strategies

- A person goes through the documentation and checks off criteria listed below.
- Gather feedback from new community members using below survey questions.
- Include a quick survey (“was this page helpful”) at the bottom of every page.


## 4. Sample Success Metrics
_Qualitative_

- Is the documentation screen reader friendly?
  * TODO: link to a tool that evaluates this.
  * TODO: provide an interpretation guide for the output of the tool.
  * TODO: what result will indicate good diversity and inclusion?

- Interview with newcomers to find out how documentation helped (a) understand the contribution process and/or (b) help complete the task
  * TODO: write specific questions that can be asked of the newcomer
  * TODO: provide an analysis method for the questions
  * TODO: decide what kind of answers signal good diversity and inclusion

_Quantitative_

- Quick bottom-page survey
  * TODO: add specific questions
  * TODO: ways to analyze them.
