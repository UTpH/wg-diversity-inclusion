## Question

**Question**: What opportunities are there to move into governance?

## 1. Description

For an open source project to live diversity, it has to embrace it at the core leadership team. The process of becoming a core member needs to be explained and available to diverse groups of people.
Depending on the project, being a core member of a project is based on meritocracy through some internal elections at the project. For this there are cases where this is measured as achievements of that person (reviews or commits done) and some others where this is not required and based on the perception of the members of the community.


## 2. Sample Objectives

- A project member needs to know that someone is representing their interest
- Having a diverse set of project leaders helps others to see themselves reflected and advanced in their career
- Help technical leaders to understand the current situation of the community in terms of diversity and inclusion
- Help the community to understand how inclusive their technical leaders are


## 3. Sample Strategies

- Observe the diversity of the technical leaders of each of the projects within a community
- Observe the diversity of the technical leaders of each of the modules in a project (useful when measuring more monolithic repositories)
- Survey the project members about their perceived diversity of the technical leaders
- Survey the community about their perceived diversity of the technical leaders
- Survey the technical leaders about their perceived diversity of the community

## 4. Sample Success Metrics

**Qualitative**
- None

**Quantitative**
- Observe the diversity of the technical leaders from the project webpage
- Survey the board about their technical leaders in each of the projects.
- Survey project members about their perceived diversity of the technical leaders.
  - Likert scale [1-5] item: I feel represented in the technical leaders.
  - Likert scale [1-5] item: The technical leaders attentive to minorities within the project.
  - Likert scale [1-5] item: The technical leaders represent the diversity of the project community.
- Survey the technical leaders about the diversity of the community
- Survey the community about the perceived inclusivity of their technical leaders
