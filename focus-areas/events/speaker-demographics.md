## Question

**Question:** How well does the speaker lineup for the event represent a diverse set of demographics?

## 1. Description

Speakers with diverse backgrounds who represent a [variety of demographics](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/blob/master/di_metrics.md) help an event provide different viewpoints and a broader perspective. Events with diverse speakers allow people from a variety of different backgrounds feel more included in an event when they see people with similar characteristics in a position of authority (speaking).

## 2. Sample Objectives
- Speakers are from diverse backgrounds.
- Speakers are diverse when grouped by keynotes, sessions, and tracks.
- Repeat speakers are from diverse backgrounds (retention). 

## 3. Sample Strategies
- Review conference website to gather data.
- Survey and / or interview speakers and attendees.
- Diverse proposals submitted compared to those who were accepted
- Registration data or event organizers may be able to provide data/stats

## 4. Sample Success Metrics

_Qualitative_

- Interview speakers and attendees to understand more about why the speakers did or did not meet their diversity and inclusion expectations.
  * Interview question (ask speakers): What can we do to improve the diversity and inclusion of speakers at this event?
  * Interview question (ask all attendees): Did you feel represented by the speakers?

_Quantitative_

- Survey speakers and attendees to learn to what extent the event met their diversity and inclusion expectations.
  * Interview question (ask all attendees): How well did the event meet your diversity and inclusion expectations? (likert scale (e.g., 1-5) answer)
- Use the event website, registration data, and other available details about speakers to quantify speaker diversity.
  * Other details may include speakersâ€™ twitter account, listed pronouns, descriptions, or other speaking engagements.
